# Grand Prix Manager 2003 for CASIO CFX-9850 GB Plus calculators

Grand Prix Manager 2003 is a game I wrote for the CASIO CFX-9850 GB Plus calculator back in 2003 during math classes in high school. You'll find the source code [here](gpmanager2003.txt). See the installation instructions below on how to get it on your calculator.

Below is the original manual of the game from back in 2003.

## Manual

### The Money

This game is all about money and luck. Even for those who aren't F1 fans this game will be nice to play. You can get money by racing. The higher you finish, the higher the prize money. Another source of money are your sponsors. After the first race you will see that you can press [F6] to look for a sponsor. You can see how much the next race will cost you. Sponsors won't come when you don't have much points. This makes scoring points essential to survive. When you're out of cash, you are Game Over.

### The Teams

All 10 Official FIA Formula 1 Grand Prix teams and drivers are in this game. You can choose them all. Every team has its own drivers and its performances. You'll also find out that each team has its own amount of money.

### Testing

Testing is neccesary if you want to keep scoring points or even to improve. It's the only way to improve in this game. You can test three times between every Grand Prix. The more you test, the better you get and the more sponsors will come.

### Saving/Loading

This is the newest small option I've added. You all know the fact that teachers don't like you playing games in class. You'll have to turn off your calculator and restart GPM2003. Very irritating to start all over again.

Now with this option you can just go back where you were by pressing the [F3] key in the first menu (where you choose a team). This will bring you right back to the game you were playing.

NOTE: This will not work properly if you play GPM2003, play another game, and then load the last game. The game won't crash, but all the values will be lost.

### Cheating

Since the save game option is available, you can change almost everything in your 'savegame'. Just close the game and change the values of the letters.

For example: You were game over and you want to continue with your team (could be realistic). You go to your main calculator screen (number 1 from the menu) and press any number following `-> B` (B=budget, the money you have. F.E. `10 -> B`) If you now start the game and load your previous game, you will have tha amount of money. The you can re-develop your team (even if you were game over).

I'm not going to tell what letter is for what thing in the game, you'll find out as you try.  

### Known bugs

We found out that sometimes the team name and the driver names aren't shown. We don't know wat it is yet. You can fix it by going to the Memory Usage screen and Clear all your memories except the Programs. Reboot the calculator and it might work.

### What can you do NOT in this game

We haven't spend time yet on:

- Swapping drivers
- Build factories
- Standings

So you cannot change your drivers and build factories. The biggest problem is that you can't win a championship.

## Memory usage

This program is between 4000 and 4500 bytes big. Check the memory Usage screen whether you have enough memory left. You may need even more available to play the game.

## Installation instructions

The program is written on a CASIO CFX-9850 GB PLUS, but might also work on other (CASIO) calculators.

How to get the right singns into your calculator:

| Symbol | How to enter it |
| --- | --- |
| -> | the arrow under the letter L |
| <> | SHIFT+VARS+F6+F3+F2 |
| x | multiply sign |
| : | dividing sign |
| r | Alpha + the button on the right of the alpha button |
| => | press [shift] [vars] [F6] [F3] [F3] |

Enter the lines from the [source code](gpmanager2003.txt) in your program screen. After every line, press the exe key.
